what i've worked on
	setting up project: checking project setup with TA, setting up github, adding necessary files, creating plan for the project
what problems i encountered
	figuring out github was a bit of work
what i learned
	using github
which resources did i use
	tutorial in project module

what i've worked on
	visualising concept final layout and interactions for project
	interactive world map visualisation with bokeh: how to do it, looking for world map data
what problems i encountered
	unsure how to best visualise data & hard to determine what is doable
	the curse of open source: many, many different datasets in different formats
what i learned
	definition of a choropleth map
	geoJSON and topoJSON data formats
	basics of bokeh
which resources did i use
	bokeh documentation: linked tutorials in module, mapping geo data, info about geojson data, choropleth
	github world atlas data, finally got referred to Natural Earth Data
	https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-adults-defined-as-obese as inspiration for the project

what i've worked on
	cleaning up data, plotting world map, merging data, first steps in creating world map plot
what problems i encountered
	country IDs do not overlap, even after conversion, some countries are lost in merged dataset
	multiple areas are not found in country converter ISO library
	could not get countries colored in on the world map
what i learned
	choropleth mapping, bokeh colorbars, country_converter library
which resources did i use
	country_converter documentation
	bokeh documentation: choropleth, color bar, palettes

what i've worked on
	coloring countries according to their data
	creating ways to convert IDs and fully merge needed data, fixing duplicates and false NaN plots
what problems i encountered
	some countries falsely showed NaN when plotted, could not figure out where it went wrong, turns out: duplicate rows.
	dataset too big to load to work with javascript, not proficient enough in JS to figure out a way around
	Bokeh serve: different way of calling filenames in notebook vs bokeh server, troubleshooting continuous issues with server
what i learned
	updating figure with bokeh slider callbacks - tried this both in JavaScript and Python functions
	setting up bokeh server
which resources did i use
	bokeh documentation: JS callbacks, bokeh server gallery and source code
	lots of stackoverflow for errors i got

what i've worked on
	setting up hover tool, creating two plots next to each other (fertility and life expectancy)
	streamlining the figure: colorbar tick labels, 'highlighting' countries on hover
	reworked the way data was cleaned before merging, redefined some geodata to split into different countries or be labelled as one
what problems i encountered
	plot title is defined in first function, but i cannot recall
	discovered merging issues: ISO codes were wrong > country data got merged to wrong country, countries in geodata are measured as collective in gapminder and other way around.
what i learned
	bokeh hover tool, grid layout for figures
	editing geopandas data, using the hover tool to discover indices of plotted patches
which resources did i use
	geopandas documentation
	bokeh documentation
	google maps (for checking country locations on the world map)

what i've worked on
	selecting regions in map data > double filtering took too much time, decided not to do this
	graphing values over time for regions
what problems i encountered
	map moves *very* slow: replots patches for every year, instead of changing fill color
	plotting charts: averages per region and global averages over the years
what i learned
	plotting interactive graphs, printing paragraphs, interactive legends
	multiline plots vs plotting individual lines
which resources did i use
	bokeh documentation
	bokeh discourse

date of entry

what i've worked on
	calculating and displaying overall growth in regional charts
	cleaning up and organising code, updating project description
what problems i encountered
	not having enough time for everything! there are several things i still want to do to make the plots clearer/faster/better, but i cannot do it all
	paragraphs are not interactive in bokeh, legends are not multiline
	having to check process book and not knowing if entries are complete for the day they were written on
what i learned
	creating tabs in bokeh
	a little bit of html printing, though i did not use it
what resources did i use
	bokeh documentation
	style guide
